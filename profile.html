                April 2022 - July 2022â”‚REVA University- Department Electronics
                And Communication Engineering, Bengaluru, Karnataka
                In the field of IoT in Door Lock Systems, I have appliedfor a patent
                to Intellectual Property INDIA and the patent number is
                202241043680.
                The product is called "Smart Door Lock based on RFID with a
                GSMmodule".
                The device is an innovation in the IoT field where we use RFID, GSM,
                and KEYPAD to provide the user with a secure means to unlock
                theirhome or gain access to any building.
                As this method operates on the cellular network and is therefore
                standalone, it is more reliable since there is no chance of a
                cyberattack taking place, as well as having a lower maintenance
                cost.
                In addition to being intuitive and easy to install, this device
                offers 100 percent one-to-one service and does not rely on any
                middle manor intermediary for its monitoring.

                    <h4>Abstract:</h4>
                    <ul>Software Defined Radio is the device used for radio
                    communication in which software is used to alter its various
                    parameters like frequency selection, Modulation and
                    demodulation technique and error correction methods. SDR is
                    widely used in space communication like satellite communication,
                    audio and video broadcasting, multimedia communications,
                    Aircraft navigations Etc. This research work carries some of the
                    commonly used Software Defined Radios (SDR) available in the
                    market. And we have made a comparative study on various
                    parameters used in SDR's Parameters like
